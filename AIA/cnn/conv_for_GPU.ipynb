    "1. **Inefficient Looping Structure:**\n",
    "   The basic algorithm uses nested loops to traverse the input chanel, resulting in $O(H \\times W \\times k_h \\times k_w)$ time complexity. This becomes computationally expensive as the input size or the kernel dimensions increase.\n",

    "1. Create arrays representing starting indices of each patch along $x$ and $y$ axes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_start = np.arange(0, h - filter, stride)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. After that, we need to add the ability to traverse each patch. Doing so allows us to get indices of each element within each patch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dy, dx = np.mgrid[0:filter, 0:filter]\n",
    "\n",
    "# indices of each element within the patch along two axes:\n",
    "y_indices = y_starts[:, :, None, None] + dy\n",

    "\n",
    "# This matrix stores (i, j) indices for each element in every convolutional patch.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using the results from step 3, we now have the ability to get indices of any input element. The remaining step is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use advanced indexing to transform the input $X$ into our desired format.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the most challenging aspect of this notebook, as we need to carefully implement the backward pass functionality for the input $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with $d_{out}$, the gradient tensor received from subsequent layers, having the shape $(batch\\_size, h_{out}, w_{out}, out\\_channels)$. To simplify further computations, we first reshape this tensor into $(batch\\_size \\cdot h_{out} \\cdot w_{out}, out\\_channels)$, allowing us to handle gradients over each output channel uniformly across all batches. Given the weights tensor reshaped to $(filter \\cdot filter \\cdot in\\_channels, out\\_channels)$, we then compute the gradient with respect to the input by performing the matrix multiplication:\n",

    "$$, identical to the shape obtained previously from the `im2conv_matrix` operation. This correspondence is logical and expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step is to transform these gradient values back into the original input tensor format of shape $(batch\\_size, in\\_channels, h_{in}, w_{in})$. It's crucial to understand that some elements in the gradient matrix correspond to overlapping input patches and thus repeat. Therefore, simply reshaping the gradient matrix is insufficient—we must properly accumulate gradient values at each input position.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `col2im_backward` function accumulates gradients back to their respective positions in the original input tensor. This operation is necessary due to overlapping patches: multiple patches contribute to the same input pixel, requiring a summation of their gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initialize the Gradient Tensor**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an empty gradient tensor (`result`) initialized with zeros, matching the shape of the original input tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = np.zeros((batch_size, in_channels, h_in, w_in))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Generate Indices for Mapping Back to Original Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the sames indices computed previously by the `im2col_idx` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch indices** (`batch_indices`)\n",
    "- **Channel indices** (`channel_indices`)\n",
    "- **Height and Width indices** (`y_indices`, `x_indices`)\n",
    "\n",
    "These indices specify exactly where each element of `dx_patches` maps back into the original tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Expand and Align Dimensions for Broadcasting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcast indices to align them correctly with each other, preparing for a scatter operation. The resulting arrays all share the same shape to correspond element-wise:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y_indices = y_indices[np.newaxis, :, :, np.newaxis, :, :]\n",
    "x_indices = x_indices[np.newaxis, :, :, np.newaxis, :, :]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Broadcasting indices\n",
    "batch_indices_exp = batch_indices + np.zeros_like(y_indices) + np.zeros_like(channel_indices)\n",
    "channel_indices_exp = channel_indices + np.zeros_like(y_indices) + np.zeros_like(batch_indices)\n",
    "y_indices_exp = y_indices + np.zeros_like(channel_indices) + np.zeros_like(batch_indices)\n",
    "x_indices_exp = x_indices + np.zeros_like(channel_indices) + np.zeros_like(batch_indices)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures all indices have identical dimensions, crucial for accurately accumulating gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Flattening the Indices and Gradient Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently apply NumPy’s scatter-add operation, flatten all indices and gradient arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "batch_indices_flat = batch_indices_exp.ravel()\n",
    "channel_indices_flat = channel_indices_exp.ravel()\n",
    "y_indices_flat = y_indices_exp.ravel()\n",
    "x_indices_flat = x_indices_exp.ravel()\n",
    "dx_patches_flat = dx_patches.ravel()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This flattening step is critical as NumPy's `np.add.at` function operates on one-dimensional indexing arrays, this means that the length of each indexing array after broadcasting and extending will be the same and equal to total numbers of elements to add to result, then the n-th element of the values array(`dx_patches_flat[n]`) will be added to position `result[batch_indices_flat[n], channel_indices_flat[n], y_indices_flat[n], x_indices_flat[n]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Accumulating Gradients Using `np.add.at`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `np.add.at` function to accumulate gradients at the correct locations in the initialized gradient tensor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "np.add.at(result,\n",
    "          (batch_indices_flat, channel_indices_flat, y_indices_flat, x_indices_flat),\n",
    "          dx_patches_flat)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use `np.add.at`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The convolution operation produces overlapping patches. Thus, the gradient from one pixel location is usually distributed across multiple patches.\n",
    "- Simply assigning or adding values would overwrite data or be inefficient in terms of numpy internal logic; instead, `np.add.at` ensures gradients from overlapping patches are summed correctly, handling the repeated indices appropriately. Unlike typical buffered updates, it performs direct, unbuffered in-place additions, guaranteeing correct accumulation even with repeated indices.\n",
